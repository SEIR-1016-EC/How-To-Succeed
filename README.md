- Being confused/lost is NORMAL. 
- This experience is a rollercoaster. This is true on a lesson-by-lesson basis, as well as throughout a content unit.

- Your job during this cohort is learning to jumping into that confusion and being able to find a solution!
- The maximum point of learning is right at the edge of learning and panic.

# Traits of successful GA students

The most successful students find programming fascinating. They don't think of it as an obligation or chore. Each blocker, each bug is an opportunity to learn about the tools we are using and the languages we are learning. 

- Successful students approaching each task as a puzzle to solve. The “broken” code will present opportunities for learning rather than be a permanent setback.
- The most successful students go above and beyond what we teach.
    - If there is something they feel they should know, they will go and learn it.
    - If there is a problem for which they think they need more information to solve, they go and find that information.
    - If they find a solution, they share it with / teach others to cement their understanding and proficiency with the new material.
- The most successful students don't wait for instructors to hand them the answer.
- Successful students quickly see that programming is not about learning a recipe, it's about developing a mindset to anticipate and solve unforeseen problems.
- Successful students are open and ready to receive constructive criticism.

## **Grit & Persistence**

“Grit is the tendency to sustain interest in and effort toward very long-term goals.” -  [video on Grit](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_the_key_to_success_grit?language=en)

The bootcamp experience is like three months of "cramming for finals" - it is *intense* - it can feel  overwhelming, confusing, and maybe "impossible";  there may be time you will feel like giving up. 

The key to success in these moments is to recognize that, yes, it is hard, but you have faced earlier challenges in the cohort and you overcame those. 

In fact you probably ‘crushed it’ - when faced with a blocker is can be helpful to acknowledge the challenge: 
    
    *Yes, This is hard, for now, but won’t be forever.*

This challenge and your confusion in the moment, while a blocker, is not a permanent condition. 

    *You will figure it out.* 

Recognizing how much you have grown, and will continue to grow in this course; this self-awareness and persistence it is essential to moving ahead in this field. 

    *Grit and perseverance are not innate, they are learned skill, just like any other.*

It will take time but you will overcome today’s challenge, and you’ll probably find another blocker (or two) tomorrow. 

    Each day you are building up your ‘grit’ by working through your blockers.

If you feel stuck, blocked, overwhelmed - **keep going!** - today might have been hard but tomorrow you will find the next challenge easier to face.
